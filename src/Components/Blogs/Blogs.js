            <h1>What is Context API? What is the purpose of it?</h1>

            <h1>What is Semantic tag?</h1>
            <p>Answer: </p>
            <h1>What is the difference between Inline, Block and Inline-Block Elements?</h1>
            <p>Answer: Inline property of display can display an element as an inline element, i.e., the element does not start on a new line and hold just the width it requires. Whereas, an inline-block element is formatted just like the inline element, but in this case, width and height can not be set. On the other hand, block property of display can display an element as an block element, i.e., the element start on a new line and takes the width available.</p>
